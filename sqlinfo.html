        <h1>Data</h1>
        <p>Data is the collection of raw fcts and figures that  can be organized and interpreted into useful information.</p>
        <h2>Data Types</h2>
        <p>
            Data types are the classification of data items. They determine the kind of value a variable can hold and what operations can be performed on it. Common data types include:
            <ul>
                <li>Integer: Whole numbers without a fractional component.</li>
                <li>Float: Numbers that contain a decimal point.</li>
                <li>String: A sequence of characters, often used to represent text.</li>
                <li>Date: Represents dates and times.</li>
                <li>Boolean: Represents true or false values.</li>
            </ul>

        <h1>Database</h1>
        <p>A database is an organized collection of structured information or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. It allows for efficient data management, retrieval, and manipulation.</p>
        <h2>Types of databases</h2>
        <p>
            There are several types of databases, each designed for specific use cases:
            <ul>
                <li>Relational Database: Uses tables to store data and relationships between them (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).</li>
                <li>NoSQL Database: Designed for unstructured data, often using key-value pairs or document storage (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).</li>
                <li>Graph Database: Focuses on relationships between data points (e.g., Neo4j).</li>
                <li>Object-Oriented Database: Stores data in objects, similar to object-oriented programming (e.g., db4o).</li>
            </ul>

        <h1>Database Management System</h1>
        <p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that interacts with databases, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data. It provides a systematic way to manage data and ensures data integrity and security.</p>
